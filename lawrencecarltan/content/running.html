<p>As a person who thrives on routine, I've found that running keeps me grounded. It's where I find rhythm, clarity and challenge outside of work. I've completed four marathons thus far, including the Chicago, Sydney and Berlin Marathon Majors. Running continues to teach me something new about discipline, pacing, and resilience daily.</p>
<p>These days, I’m focused on attaining a 3.5 hour marathon finish. You can see my weekly mileage below, straight from Strava.</p>
